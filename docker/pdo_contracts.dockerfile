# PURPOSE: run test suite

# For a complete, automated test environment we need PDO ledger, PDO services, a
# PDO client that is extended with the contract source. For complete testing we
# need an OpenVINO model server and the associated guardian service. We can
# assume that all components are running on localhost. PDO provides the docker
# and docker compose files that are necessary for running the PDO services.
# The contracts code must be built from a client image that has the same version
# as the pdo code in the contracts repository.

# One possibility is to build our own images for PDO ledger, PDO services and
# PDO client using the pdo submodule in the contracts repo. The advantage of
# this is that we know the versions will match. THe disadvantage is that it
# might be a lot of work. Although we might trust docker to "get it right" if we
# rebuild layers that have already been built. This seems like the best approach.

# When building the client one

# PURPOSE: develop and test contracts with clean
