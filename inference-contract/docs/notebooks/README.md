# Using Jupyter Labs for Inference Contracts #

This directory contains sample Jupyter notebooks that can be
used to create and interact with contract objects (or collections of
objects) in the Inference contract family. The structure of 
notebooks follows the pattern followed by the notebooks used to illustrate
the exchange contracts family. Please see exchange contracts' 
[notebooks](../exchange-contract/docs/notebooks/README.md)
for details about installation and general structure of notebooks.
