# Inference Contract Family

The Inference contract family is a suite of contracts that extend the 
capabilities of the [Exchange Contract Family ](../exchange/documents/overview.ipynb) 
in order to create a confidentiality preserving policy-wrapper around the
usage of a machine learning (ML) model. This directory contains sample 
Jupyter notebooks that can be used to create and interact with contract
objects in the Inference contract family. The structure of notebooks follows 
the pattern followed by the notebooks used to illustrate the exchange contracts
family.

More detailed information about the inference contract family is available in the
[Inference Contract Family Overview](documents/overview.ipynb).

## Factories

The links below connect you to "factories" for creating contract objects in the Inference contract family.
