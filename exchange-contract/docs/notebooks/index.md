# Exchange Contract Family

The Exchange contract family is a suite of contracts that demonstrate many of the capabilities of the private data objects technologies. Three basic contracts define the elements of the Exchange contract family: the asset type contract, the vetting organization contract, and the issuer contract. Three additional contracts extend the Exchange contract family for trading potentially confidential assets using non-fungible tokens.

More detailed information about the exchange contract family is available in the
[Exchange Contract Family Overview](documents/overview.ipynb).
