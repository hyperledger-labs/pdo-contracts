    "# Exchange Contract Family Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Exchange contract family is a suite of contracts that demonstrate many of the capabilities of the private data objects technologies.Three basic contracts define the elements of the Exchange contract family: the\n",
    "asset type contract, the vetting organization contract, and the issuer contract. Three additional contracts extend the Exchange contract family for trading potentially confidential assets using non-fungible tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contracts for Traditional Assets\n",
    "\n",
    "An *asset type* contract object defines a unique, shared identifier for a type\n",
    "of digital asset and a schema for the representation for assets of that\n",
    "type. For example, we might define an asset type contract object for blue\n",
    "marbles. Since the identifier for the contract object is unique, it provides a\n",
    "shared, unique identifier that can be used to refer to assets that are blue\n",
    "marbles.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *vetting organization* contract object manages a list of contract objects\n",
    "authorized to issue assets of a particular type. While actual vetting of an\n",
    "issuer occurs outside the contract object, the object provides a means of\n",
    "recording the decision to authorize an issuer. In this way, the vetting\n",
    "organization contract object provides a root of trust for issuers of a\n",
    "particular asset type. Continuing the blue marble example, the Blue Marble\n",
    "Players Association might create a vetting organization object to record the\n",
    "identities of local chapters that may issue blue marble holdings to their\n",
    "members.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *issuer* contract object maintains a balance sheet that captures ownership\n",
    "of assets of a particular type. The issuer contract allows the creator of the\n",
    "contract object to issue assets (that is, assign ownership of assets to a\n",
    "particular individual). However, once the initial issuance occurs,\n",
    "confidentiality of transactions and balances is maintained; in this case, even\n",
    "the creator of the issuer contract object is not granted the right to examine\n",
    "the quantity of assets owned by an individual after the initial issuance. Local\n",
    "chapters of the Blue Marble Players Association each create an issuer contract\n",
    "object to assign ownership of marbles to their members. Once the initial\n",
    "issuance is complppete, members can trade marbles, transfer ownership, or\n",
    "exchange different kinds of marbles in complete confidentiality. And, for those\n",
    "who trust the Blue Marble Players Association, those transactions can span local\n",
    "chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the issuer contract object supports simple ownership transfer, more\n",
    "complex multi-party exchanges are managed through additional contracts. For\n",
    "example, an exchange contract mediates a fair exchange of different kinds of\n",
    "marbles (e.g. Alice trades her red marbles for Bob's blue marbles). More complex\n",
    "exchanges like a blind auction can be implemented as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [detailed walk through](flow.ipynb) of the process is availble.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contracts for Confidential, Non-Fungible Assets\n",
    "\n",
    "One blue marble is generally indistinguishable from another; that is, blue\n",
    "marbles are considered \"fungible\". In contrast, each red sports car is a unique\n",
    "thing with a distinct title of ownership; that is, red sports cards are\n",
    "considered \"non-fungible\". In order to represent non-fungible assets like a red\n",
    "sports car, the Exchange contract family defines a special kind of issuer,\n",
    "called a *token issuer*. Like the issuers for fungible tokens, the token issuer\n",
    "has an asset type and vetting organization. A token issuer contract object\n",
    "\"mints\" a fixed number of *tokens* (another kind of contract object) that\n",
    "correspond to unique instances of the asset type. To make this more concrete,\n",
    "the asset type might refer to red sports cars (a generic kind of car), the token\n",
    "issuer is like a manufacturer that creates specific instances (tokens) of the\n",
    "red sports car. Each token represents a specific red sports car.\n",
    "\n",
    "The red sports car analogy works well for traditional sense of ownership (where\n",
    "ownership implies \"possession\"). However, the Exchange contract family extends\n",
    "the notion of ownership to imply a right to use an asset for a specific\n",
    "purpose. In this case, the asset itself (the red sports car), is wrapped by a\n",
    "*guardian* contract and the token issuer mints tokens that grant the right to\n",
    "use the guarded asset. Pushing the analogy well beyond reason, we might think of\n",
    "the token, in this case, as the right to drive the car for a specific time\n",
    "period.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the implementation of the token issuer, token, and guardian contract are\n",
    "relatively simplistic, they provide a basis for defining and enforcing a rich\n",
    "set of policies. Other contract families can use these basic building blocks for\n",
    "many applications like the right to use digital images for specific purposes or\n",
    "the right to query a classification model."
