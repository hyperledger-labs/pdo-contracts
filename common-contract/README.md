# Common Contract Resources #

This directory contains module and documentation resources that are
shared across all contract families. Specifically, it includes:

* Python modules to simplify building contexts within a contract family
* Python modules for Jupyter widgets to manage PDO configuration of keys, services and groups
* Jupyter notebooks for working with the Jupyter widgets

Python modules are available through the `pdo.contracts` namespace.
