# # Token Family Factory
#
# This notebook simplifies the creation of an instance of a token issuer for a digital asset (in
# this case assets are 24bit bmp images). Update the token configuration information then evaluate
# the notebook to create a new token issuer. That token issuer will be able to mint tokens.

# ## Configure Token Information
#
# This section enables customization of the token that will be minted. The two main tabs on the form
# allow specification of the token properties and the configuration of the services used for the
# token contracts.
#
# The token properties include:
# * Token Class: the unique name for the token class
# * Token Description: text description of the token
# * Count: number of tokens to create for the asset
# * Image File: the image file, at the moment this must be a 24-bit BMP file
# * Privacy Border: a band of pixels that will never be exposed to verify authenticity
#
# The service properties include:
# * Identity: the identity of the token creator
# * Service Groups: information about the service groups to use for contract execution
#
# Use the key manager and groups manager to configure additional identities or services.
